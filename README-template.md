## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
@mixin image-fit($pos, $rep, $size) {
    background-position: $pos;
    background-repeat: $rep;
    background-size: $size;
}

.abs {
  width: 50%;
  .feature-text {
      position: absolute;
      bottom: 0;
      left: 48%;
      width: 60%;
      padding: $body-copy * 5;
      text-align: left;
      background-color: $white;

      .text {
          padding: 0;
          margin-top: $body-copy + 10;
      }
      
  }
  }
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**

### Continued development

After completing this project with scss best practices I will move on to learn some danger scss (industry level) and using the BEM methodology of writting css.

Next I will also add some JS animation to my web pages to make it more interactive and playfull.



### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for to refresh my knowledge of css and semantic HTML. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand CSS best practices. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
